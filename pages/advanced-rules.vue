      The X-Files<sup>TM</sup> Collectible Card Game
    </h3>
    <p>Welcome to <b>The X-Files Collectible Card Game</b> Advanced Game. The Advanced Game incorporates many of the nuances of <b>The X-Files</b> television series and is designed for the more serious gamer and <b>The X-Files</b> fan.</p>
    <p>If you have not previously read the <b>Basic Game</b> rule book, we recommend that you read pages <page-link>4</page-link> through <page-link>7</page-link>; these pages will give you an introduction to <b>The X-Files Collectible Card Game</b> and the game's objective. If you are proceeding to the Advanced Game after learning the Basic Game, go on to the <b>Game Setup</b> section on the following page.</p>
    <p>In the Advanced Game, you will construct your deck of cards for game play. This gives each player greater control over the outcome of the game than in the Basic Game, where players use Starter Decks.The Advanced Game will allow each player to cater their Agents and cards to the Skills and strategy desired. It will be up to you to help Mulder and Scully solve their current X-File.</p>

      Advanced Game Set-up
    </h3>
    <p>The <b>Advanced Game</b> is designed for two or more players. The game is won by the first player who identifies one opponent's X-File. Game set-up for Advanced Game is similar to that of the Basic Game.</p>
    <p>For the Advanced Game, remove all Keyword <b>"Killer"</b> cards (see <b>Killer Cards</b> on page <page-link>42</page-link>). An explanation of all card types can be found on pages <page-link>48</page-link> through <page-link>63</page-link> of these rules. Agent cards may also be included in your deck for use during the game. They are shuffled into your deck and may assist for one turn (see <b>Playing Cards</b> section on page <page-link>14</page-link>). Separate your X-File cards and place them to the side.</p>
    <p>In the Advanced Game, you will be <u>constructing</u> your <b>Bureau Deck</b>. Your deck must have a minimum of sixty cards but may have more if you like. Your starting Agents and the X-File do not count toward this minimum. You may choose any cards, provided no more than two of the same card are used. You may include Agents in your deck. An Agent from your hand can be used to help out for one turn.</p>
    <p>Pay attention to the <b>Cost</b> to play each card. Having many cards that you cannot afford to play can de detrimental (see the <b>Playing Cards</b> section on page <page-link>41</page-link>). Note that you will probably want to create the Bureau Deck in conjunction with selecting Agents and an X-File. For additional Deck Construction suggestions, see page <page-link>46</page-link> of these rules.</p>
    <p>As in the Basic Game, select an X-File card.Place your X-File face down in a prominent place, as you may need to refer to it when your opponent asks questions.</p>

    </h4>
    <p>In the Advanced Game, you may choose any number of Agents you like for your initial <b>Team</b>, provided there are no duplicates and the sum of all Agents' Costs does not exceed 20.The Agent's Cost is a rating relative to each Agent's game value and appears in the lower right corner of the Agent card. Your Team should be a minimum of three Agents, but can be more. Each player is allowed to have the same Agent.</p>
    <p>Each player divides the surface area they are playing on into three sections: the <b>Bureau</b>, the <b>Fields</b> and the <b>Hospital</b>. Your Agents begin the game in the Bureau section.</p>
    <p>Create a <b>Discard Pile</b> face-up next to your Bureau Deck when it becomes necessary. This will be used for discarding excess cards and cards you have used. Should the Bureau Deck ever run out of cards, shuffle your Discard Pile to recreate the Bureau Deck and  cotinue play.</p>
    <p><b>The X-Files Notebook</b> and <b>tokens</b> will also be needed for the Advanced Game. The Notebook is a checklist used to track information about your opponent's X-File(s). Tokens will be used to track certain information</p>

      Pools
    </h3>
    <p>In the Advanced Game, cards must be paid for in order to use their effects. This is done through the use of two pools: the <b>Resource Pool (RP)</b> and <b>Conspiracy Pool (CP)</b>. Each player will have one Conspiracy Pool and one Resource Pool.</p>
    <v-alert type="info">
      At the beginning of an Advanced Game, create the Resource Pool by placing five tokens in your Bureau section. Creat the Conspiracy Pool by placing five tokens by your X-File.
    </v-alert>
    <p>The Resource and Conspiracy Pools are used to pay for cards played by each player. All cards will have an <b>RP</b>, <b>CP</b> or <b>*P</b> icon - <resource-pool />, <conspiracy-pool /> or <star-pool /> -- under their Cost.</p>

      Resource Pool
    </h3>
    <p>Your <b>Resource Pool</b> represents the resource the Bureau has at its disposal. Resource Points are used to pay for the cards that assist your Agents. These cards have an <resource-pool /> or <star-pool /> under their Cost.</p>
    <p>During the <b>Briefing Phase</b>, you will have a chance to add to your Resource Pool. Every Agent has a Resource (<b>RES</b>) number listed on the upper right section of the card.</p>
    <v-alert

      color="info"
      class="text-center"

      An example of an Agent card's RES Number. [[IMAGE]]
    </v-alert>
    <p>Add up all Agent's RES numbers. This is the number of tokens that may be added to the Resource Pool at the beginning of your turn. Agents in the Hospital during the Briefing Phase do not contribute their RES number to create <resource-pool />s. After adding the <resource-pool />s to your pool, you may then purchase cards. Each card costs <b>1</b> <resource-pool />. Purchased cards are always taken from the top of the Bureau Deck. All cards must be purchased ar once. A player may not purchase cards and then decide to purchase more after looking at the cards purchased. Regardless of how many cards are bought, no player's hand may exceed seven cards (but can be less) at the end of a turn.</p>
    <p>To keep the Resource Pool and Conspiracy Pool separate, we suggest putting the Resource Pool in the Bureau and the Conspiracy Pool by your X-File card.</p>
    <p class="text-center">
      11
    </p>
    <h3 id="12">
      Conspiracy Pool
    </h3>
    <p>Each player's X-File also has a pool used to purchase cards played. This is called the <b>Conspiracy Pool</b>. Your Conspiracy Pool represents the resources your X-File has at its disposal. Conspiracy Points are used to pay for cards used by the X-File to oppose investigations. These cards have a <conspiracy-pool /> or <star-pool /> under their cost.</p>
    <p>Replenishment of the Conspiracy Pool happens primarily during the opposing player's turn. When the Investigating Player has finished creating <resource-pool />s and buying cards during the Briefing Phase, all players other than the Investigating Player have the following options:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>The player to the Investigating Player's left may choose to discard cards from their hand with an <resource-pool /> or <star-pool /> Cost and add this number of <conspiracy-pool />s to their Conspiracy Pool. Thus, a card with <b>3</b> <conspiracy-pool /> Cost could be discarded in exchange for <b>3</b><conspiracy-pool />s.</li>
      <li>After the player has completed turning in cards, they may buy cards. Cards may be purchased for <b>1</b><conspiracy-pool /> each. Purchased cards are always taken from the top of the Bureau Deck. Regardless of how many cards are bought, any player's hand may not exceed seven cards (but can be less) at the end of a turn.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>In a multi-player game, continue to each player's left until all players have had these options.</p>
    <v-alert type="info">
      Each player must sell all cards desired prior to purchasing cards. All cards must be purchased at once. A player may not purchase cards and then decide to purchase more after looking at the cards purchased.
    </v-alert>
    <v-alert type="info">
      Agent cards included in your Bureau Deck may be sold for their RES (Resource) number of <conspiracy-pool />, not their Cost number.

      <p>{{ playerOne }} and {{ playerTwo }} are about to play a two-player Advanced Game. Each player constructs a sixty-card deck. Both players now choose an X-File and place the card face down. {{ playerOne }} selects Agents Fox Mulder, Dana Scully, Special Agent Karen Kosseff, and Jerry Lamana prior to starting the game. Agents Mulder and Scully each have a cost of <b>7</b> <resource-pool />. Agents Kosseff and Lamana each have a Cost of <b>3</b> <resource-pool />. {{ playerOne }}'s Agent's total Cost is <b>20</b>. Since he is allowed no more than <b>20</b> <resource-pool /> for his starting Agents, this is a valid selection. He could have selected any Agents with a total Cost of <b>20</b> or less. {{ playerTwo }} also selects <b>20</b> points worth of Agents.</p>
      <p>{{ playerOne }} and {{ playerTwo }} each create Bureau, Field and Hospital Sections on their playing surface. Each player places his Agents in the Bureau to start the game. Both player shuffle their cards and have the opponent cut them. These cards are placed face down in their Bureau Sections and become the Bureau decks. {{ playerOne }} and {{ playerTwo }} draw seven cards each to begin play.</p>
      <p>Each player now creates a Resource Pool (<resource-pool />) and a Conspiracy Pool (<conspiracy-pool />). {{ playerOne }} uses pennies as <resource-pool /> tokens and places five by his Bureau Deck to create this pool. He uses nickels for <resource-pool /> tokens and places five by his X-File card. {{ playerTwo }} does the same. {{ playerOne }} wins a coin toss and elects to go first. {{ playerOne }} and {{ playerTwo }} are now ready to begin the Advanced Game.</p>

      Playing Cards
    </h3>
    <p>The system by which cards are played in the Advanced Game is different from the Basic Game. Each card now has a "<b>Cost</b>" associated with playing it. You must pay the Cost to use the card's effect. Other than Cost, there is no limit to the number of cards you may play. If at any time a player plays a card and then determines they can't afford it, the card is placed on the owning player's Discard Pile. When any contradiction arises between card effects and rules, the card effect supersedes the rules.</p>
    <p>Each card will have a <resource-pool />, <conspiracy-pool /> or <star-pool /> under their <b>Cost</b> value. This indicates from which pool the cost must be paid. <resource-pool /> stands for <b>Resource Pool</b>, <conspiracy-pool /> for <b>Conspiracy Pool</b> and <star-pool /> for either.</p>
    <p>Cards with a <resource-pool /> may only be paid for by the <b>Active Player</b>.</p>
    <p>Cards with a <conspiracy-pool /> Cost may only be paid for by the <b>Conspiracy</b>.</p>
    <p>Cards with a <star-pool /> may be used by either force -- however, whichever force uses it must pay for it. See the <b>Pools</b> section on page <page-link>10</page-link> for further information.</p>
    <p>If a card has multiple effects, indicated by the phrase "Alternately" appearing on the card, the owning player must specify which effect is being used upon playing the card. They may not change to the other effect later.</p>
    <p>In addition, all cards contain <b>Keywords</b> and <b>Activators</b>. These often serve as codes indicating when cards may be playerd. See the <b>Keywords</b> section on page <page-link>17</page-link> and the <b>Activators</b> section on page <page-link>16</page-link> for further information.</p>
    <p class="text-center">

    </p>
    <h3 id="15">
      Agent Cards
    </h3>
    <p>Agent cards contain a <b>Game Effect</b> in the center of the card. This is a special effect related to the Agent's significance in <b>The X-Files</b> television series. Each of the Agents you selected to begin play may use their Game Effect.</p>
    <p>In addition to your Agents selected at the beginning of the game, you may include additional Agent cards in your Bureau Deck which can be purchased to aid for a single turn. A purchased Agent may contribute as a normal Agent for most of your turn, however their Game Effect is ignored.</p>
    <p>Agents may only be purchased during the <b>Deployment Phase</b>. A purchased Agent is treated as an Active card. When you reach the <b>Debriefing Phase</b>, the Agent is moved to the Discard Pile. You may not use duplicate Agent cards. This means you cannot purchase two of the same Agents in the same turn or purchase an Agent you already have in play.</p>

      Activators
    </h3>
    <p>Activators appear in gold in the lower left corner on a particular card. Simply stated, an Activator tells you when you may play a particular card. Acticators can be grouped into three main categories:</p>
    <p><b>ACTIVE</b>: May be played while you are the Investigating Player. You may play these cards when it is your turn.</p>
    <p><b>CONSPIRACY</b>: May be played when your are not the Investigating Player. You may play these cards during another player's turn.</p>
    <p><b>All other Activator Words</b>: May be played only in certain circumstances. The Activator tells you where or when a card may be played or what type of card currently in use a card may be played on. Refer to the Keyword on the card in play to determine if you may play your card.</p>
    <p>On an <b>Adversary</b> or <b>Event</b> card, the Activator states what conditions must be met for the card to be used. On an Equipment card, the Activator tells you what section the Agent must be in to Requisition the Equipment.</p>
    <v-alert type="info">
      All Activators must be in effect in order for the card to be played.

      Keywords
    </h3>
    <p><b>Keywords</b> appear in red in the lower left corner on a particular card. The Keyword tells you what a card is.</p>
    <p>Most often, you will check the Keywords on an opponent's card to determine if you have a playable card. If your card's Activators are contained in the other card's Keyword section, you may play your card.</p>

He discovers the Keywords "<b>SITE</b>", "<b>MULTI</b>", "<b>MOTIVE</b>", "<b>RESULT</b>", "<b>ALIEN INVESTIGATION</b>" and "<b>BUREAUCRACY</b>". From this, {{ playerOne }} determines that the card is a Site with multiple Skills and questions. The Skills which can be used are Alien Investigation or Bureaucracy and the question hey may ask upon a successful investigation is either a RESULT or MOTIVE question.
    </v-alert>
    <p>There are serveral cards which change another card's Keywords. When this occurs, only the Keyword is changed. The rest of the card remains unchanged.</p>
    <h3>Resources</h3>
    <p>One particular Keyword worth special mentions is "<b>RESOURCE</b>". The Keyword RESOURCE will appear on certain cards. A card with the Keyword "RESOURCE" remains in play in the table section stated by the Keyword on the card. If no table section is indicated on the card, place the card face up in your Bureau section. These cards remain in play until they are negated or the criteria for their removal (if listed on the Resource card) is met. When this occurs, the card is moved to your Discard Pile.</p>

      The Briefing Phase

    <p>At the beginning of the Briefing Phase, the Investigating Player may draw one card. This is a "free" draw and occurs regardless of any Agent's current status.</p>
    <p>The Investigating Player may then use his Agents to create <b>Resource Points</b> (RPs or <resource-pool />). Then they may purchase cards. Cards ar purchased from the top of the Bureau Deck at the cost of <b>1</b> <resource-pool /> each. The Investigating Player must announce how many cards they are purchasing and do so at one time. They may not purchase some and choose to purchase more later. See the <b>Resource Pool</b> section on page <page-link>11</page-link>.</p>
    <p>Any of the Investigating Player's opponents may now discard cards from their hand with an <resource-pool /> or <star-pool /> Cost and gain an equal number of <conspiracy-pool />s. This is optional. Cards that are exchanged are placed face up on the Discard Pile.</p>

    <p>During this phase, Agents with damage are allowed to recover HEALTH points. Only Agents in the Hospital may heal during this phase. Healing works as follows:</p>
    <ul class="mb-4">
      <li>
        <b>Agents with a permanent HEALTH rating of 3 or less:</b><br>
        Heal 1 point of damage now.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Agents with a permanent HEALTH rating of 4 or higher:</b><br>
        Heal 2 points of damage now.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Only Agents with a current HEALTH rating of 3 or higher after the Healing Phase are allowed to leave the Hospital during the Deployment Phase. This is true regardless of whether the trip to the Hospital was voluntary or a forced result of Combat. In the Event that an Agent has a permanent HEALTH Rating of less than 3, then the Agent may leave the Hospital when fully healed.</p>
    <p>Agents in the Hospital may not contribute their Skills to any Skill Checks.</p>
    <p>The permanent HEALTH Rating is the <b>HEALTH</b> listed on upper right of the Agent card.</p>

      The Requisition Phase
    </h4>
    <p>FBI Agents have access to an assortment of Equipment to aid in the investigation. To obtain Equipment, Agents must Requisition it. All Equipment cards state the requirements for Requisition in their Activators. Frequently, the Agent will need to be in the Bureau to get Equipment.</p>
    <p>The Investigating Player may pay for and assign Equipment to any Agent who meets the requirement on the Equipment card. Furthermore, Agents in the same Team (please see <b>Teams</b> on page <page-link>23</page-link>) are allowed to exchange Equipment during this phase. Agents may not have more than one of any particular item, but may have as many total pieces of different Equipment as they wish. Also, an Agent may only use one piece of Equipment to modify a single Skill Check.</p>
    <p><b>Example:</b></p>
    <v-alert

      color="info"
    >
      {{ playerOne }} has Scully in the field. In Long Range Combat she has two weapons, one which adds 3 to her LRC and one which adds 2. {{ playerOne }} may not have her use both at once. He must choose one weapon. Naturally, he chooses the one which does more damage.

      <p>{{ playerOne }} now enters the Healing Phase. Since this is his first turn, no Healing will occur or is needed.</p>
      <p>Let's assume that Agent Mulder has taken 5 damage and Agent Kosseff 3. Both Agents are moved to the Hospital since their HEALTH ratings have been reduced to 0. {{ playerOne }} has placed five tokens on Mulder and three on Kosseff. He does this to show that Mulder has taken all 5 points of his HEALTH in damage and Kosseff has taken all 3 of hers as well. During the Healing Phase, {{ playerOne }} removes two tokens from Mulder's card because this permanent HEALTH rating is 4+. He also removes one token from Kosseff's card because her permanent HEALTH rating is 3 or less. Neither Agent may leave the Hospital this turn, as they must heave at least 3 HEALTH to do so. The Healing Phase is completed.</p>
      <p>Remember in our turn example, no one is actually hurt or in the Hospital yet.</p>
      <p>{{ playerOne }} now begins his Requisition Phase. {{ playerOne }} has a "Knife" card in his hand. The "Knife" adds 1 to the Agent's CRC skill. This Equipment card has the Activator word "<b>BUREAU</b>". Since all of {{ playerOne }}'s Agents began the game in the Bureau, he may pay for and assign the Equipment card to any of his Agents. {{ playerOne }} removes the <b>2</b> <resource-pool /> Cost from his Resource Pool and places the Equipment card with Agent Mulder. {{ playerOne }} now has <b>7</b> <resource-pool />s left in his Resource Pool. {{ playerOne }} does not want to Requisition any more Equipment and has completed the Requisition Phase.</p>

      The Deployment Phase
    </h4>
    <p>During the Deployment Phase, each FBI Agent is sent to the location where they will be carrying out actions. All Agents may be moved to the desired location; the <b>Bureau</b>, the <b>Field</b> or the <b>Hospital</b>. An Agent in the Hospital who is not eligible to leave may not be moved.</p>
    <p>Agents must be in the Field in order to participate in a Site Investigation during the <b>Investigation Phase</b>.</p>
    <h2>Teams</h2>
    <p>During this phase, you may designate new <b>Agent Teams</b>. An Agent Team is simply a group of one or more Agents. This group may be any numner. You may designate more than one Team in the same Section if you choose. One instance where you would designate more than one Team in the same Section would be if you wanted to investigate two Sites in one turn. In this instance, you would create two Teams in the Field section. You will also have the oppertunity to designate new Teams in the Field Section at the beginning of the Investigation Phase. Any single Agent may not be part of more than one Team at a time. If new Teams are not designated, it is assumed that the most recent Team designations still apply.</p>

      The Case Assignment Phase
    </h4>
    <p>At the beginning of the Case Assignment Phase, the Investigating Player places all Sites in the Field Section that he might investigate. The Investigating Player must also pay the Cost listed on the Site card at the this time. Note that a Site being placed on the table doesn't necessarily mean that the player must ever investigate that Site.</p>
    <p>All opponents may assign Bluffs to any and/or all Sites played by the Investigating Player at this time. See the <b>Bluff</b> section on the following page.</p>
    <p>Sites played by the Investigating Player but not investigated during the Investigation Phase are moved to the Discard Pile at the end of the turn unless a Bluff is placed under the Site.</p>
    <p>Some Site cards give you a choice between two Prerequisite skills you may use. You must announce which Skill you will be using prior to investigating the Site. Once you announce which Skill you are using, you may not change to the other.</p>
    <p>If you have two identical Sites in your hand, you may not use them both in the same turn.</p>
    <p class="text-center">
      24
    </p>
    <h2 id="25">
      The Bluff
    </h2>
    <p>Bluff cards contain the Keyword "<b>Bluff</b>" and typically hinder an investigation. Cards with the Keyword "BLUFF" may be played in two ways.</p>
    <ol class="mb-4">
      <li>Cards with the Keyword "BLUFF" may be placed face down beneath a Site during the <b>Case Assignment</b> Phase by any player except the Investigating Player. Bluff cards played beneath a Site may be purchased for <b>1</b> <conspiracy-pool /> less then the Bluff card's stated Cost. The Cost is paid when the Site investigation is attempted. A Cost can never be less than 0. You cannot gain tokens as a result of playing a Bluff card with 0 Cost.</li>
      <li>Cards with the Keyword "BLUFF" may be played as normal Conspiracy cards at full Cost.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Bluffs are designed to make the Investigating Player think twice about the chance of successful investigation. Any card may be placed face down underneath the Site. These cards do not actually have to be Keyword "BLUFF" cards (non-Bluffs played as a Bluff are revealed and discarded upon Site investigation). They may in effect be "bluff" Bluffs. Cards placed under a Site as a Bluff remain there until the Site is investigated.</p>
    <p>When a Site with a Bluff is investigated, the card is revealed immediately. All cards placed as Bluffs are revealed, regardless of whether or not they contain the Keyword "BLUFF". If a card placed beneath a Site does not contain the Keyword "BLUFF", the owning player cannot afford to pay for the Bluff, or the owning player does not want to use the Bluff, the card is discarded.</p>
    <p>If the Site is not investigated this turn, the Site will remain in play with the Bluff underneath it until an investigation is attempted or the game ends. An Agent Team that investigates a Site with Bluffs beneath it "activates" these Bluffs. They are referred to as the <b>Activating Team</b>.</p>

      <p>The Case Assignment Phase is next. {{ playerOne }} places the Site "Aubrey, MO" in the Field section of the table and pays the <b>2</b> <resource-pool /> Cost indicated on the Site card. {{ playerOne }} now has <b>5</b> <resource-pool />s left in his Resource Pool. The "Aubrey, MO" card has a Prerequisite of BEHAVIORAL 4+. This means that {{ playerOne }}'s Agents investigating the Site must have 4 of more BEHAVIORAL skill in order to ask a question about {{ playerTwo }}'s X-File. Since {{ playerOne }} and {{ playerTwo }} are playing a two-player game, {{ playerTwo }} is the Directed Player by default.

      The Investigation Phase
    </h3>
    <p>The Investigating Player must allocate all Agents currently in the Field to the Site(s) they plan to investigate. The Investigating Player does not have to investigate a Site card. New Teams may now be formed in the Field section only. See the <b>Deployment Phase</b> rules on page <page-link>23</page-link> for more information on forming Agent Teams.</p>
    <p>Generally, Agents may not participate in more than one Site investigation per turn. An Agent does not necessarily have to participate in any investigations whil in the Field. Often the player will choose to investigate only one Site, however multiple or no Sites are permissible.</p>
    <p>Each Site investigated is resolved separately. If more than one Site is being investigated, the Investigating Player chooses the resolution order.</p>
    <p>Begin a Skill Check Subroutine for the Site Prerequisite. See the <b>Skill Check Subroutine</b> section of these rules on the following page for further information.</p>

      Advanced Phase Descriptions continuedâ€¦
    </h3>
    <p>
      <b>Skill Check Subroutine</b><br>
      Whenever a Skill Check is initiated, perform a Skill Check Subroutine. The Skill Check Subroutine proceeds as follows:
    </p>
    <ol class="list-style-type--lower-alpha mb-4">
      <li>Announce to your opponent the Skill being used, the amount needed, and the Skill level currently possessed by the Agent Team.</li>
      <li>Each Player may pay for and play cards.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>The current Skill level may now be modified by cards played by each player attempting to successfully complete or foil the Skill Check. The Active Player has the option to pay for and play the first card. After this, cards may be bought an played by any player. Cards must be paid for from the appropriate pool by the player who owns the card. See the <b>Pools</b> section on page <page-link>10</page-link> for further information.</p>
    <p>Multiple cards may be played prior to one card being resolved. In these instances, the last card played is resolved first. Cards are played until all players decide to play no more. One type of card which can be played is an Adversary card. These cards result in Combat. See the <b>Combat</b> section on page <page-link>31</page-link> for further information.</p>
    <p>After a card is used, place it face up on your Discard Pile. Playing a card may initiate a new Skill Check Subroutine. If this occurs, resolve this new Skill Check before resolving the original Skill Check.</p>
    <p>Certain cards may have lasting effects. This will be noted on the individual card.</p>
    <p class="text-center">
      28

    <ol
      id="29"
      start="3"
      class="list-style-type--lower-alpha mb-4"
    >
      <li>Resolve the Skill Check.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>If the Agent Team successfully meets the Skill level needed after all card effects and any additional Skill Check Subroutines have been resolved, then the appropriate effect is applied. This ends the Skill Check Subroutine.</p>
    <v-alert
      colored-border
      type="info"
    >
      There are two special cases when exceptions to the Skill Check Subroutine process occur. The first is during a Site investigation. During a Site investigation, Bluffs placed beneath a Site are revealed and resolved before any cards are played in step 2. See the <b>Bluff</b> section on page <page-link>25</page-link> for information on resolving Bluffs.
    </v-alert>
    <v-alert
      colored-border
      type="info"
    >
      The second special case is during Combat. In Combat, repeat the Skill Check Subroutine process by conducting additional Combat rounds until the Adversary's HEALTH has been reduced to 0 or all Agents have been sent to the Hospital. Also, only Combat cards may be played during a Combat Skill Check Subroutine. See the <b>Combat</b> section on page <page-link>31</page-link> for further information.
    </v-alert>
    <v-divider />
    <v-alert type="info">
      Cards may be played during a Skill Check Subroutine initiating an additional Skill Check. When this occurs, the current Skill Check Subroutine is put on hold and another Skill Check Subroutine is initiated for the new Skill Check. Also, two of the same card can't be used for the same Skill Check Subroutine; i.e., two of the same Witness on the same Skill Check.

      <p>The Investigation Phase is the next phase in {{ playerOne }}'s turn. {{ playerOne }} chooses to investigate "Aubrey, MO" with all three Agents as a Team in the Field. {{ playerOne }} currently has a BEHAVIORAL skill level of 7 (Mulder 3, Kosseff 3, Scully 1). The Bluffs {{ playerTwo }} placed beneath the Site are now immediately revealed. {{ playerTwo }}'s first Bluff is the "Car Troubles" card. This card forces {{ playerOne }} to investigate with only two Agents. {{ playerOne }} chooses to leave Scully behind, as she is only contributing 1 to the Site Prerequisite. {{ playerTwo }} pays <b>2</b> <conspiracy-pool /> for the Bluff. The actual Bluff Cost is 3, but Bluffs played face down in the Case Assignment Phase Cost <b>1</b> <conspiracy-pool /> less. {{ playerTwo }} now has <b>14</b> <conspiracy-pool /> in his Conspiracy Pool. {{ playerTwo }}'s second Bluff is not an actual Bluff. {{ playerTwo }} placed the Site card "Cape Cod, MA" underneath the Site to discourage {{ playerOne }} from investigating it. The Site card played as a Bluff is moved to {{ playerTwo }}'s Discard Pile.</p>
      <p>{{ playerOne }} now has a BEHAVIORAL skill level of 6 (Mulder 3, Kosseff 3). {{ playerTwo }} does not want {{ playerOne }} to ask a question, so he plays the Adversary card "The Manitou Stalks His Prey". The Manitou card contains the Activators "<b>CONSPIRACY</b>" and "<b>MOTIVE SITE</b>". Since it is not {{ playerTwo }}'s turn, the "<b>CONSPIRACY</b>" condition is satisfied. The "<b>MOTIVE SITE</b>" condition is also satisfied because the "Aubrey, MO" Site contains this Keyword. {{ playerTwo }} may play the Adversary card. {{ playerTwo }} pays the <b>6</b> <conspiracy-pool /> Cost and now has <b>8</b> <conspiracy-pool /> left in his Conspiracy Pool. {{ playerOne }} immediately plays his Event card "X" which negates one Adversary. {{ playerOne }} pays the <b>3</b> <resource-pool /> Cost and now has <b>2</b> <resource-pool /> left in his Resource Pool.</p>
      <p>With {{ playerOne }} still meeting the Site Prerequisite, {{ playerTwo }} decides to play another Adversary. {{ playerTwo }} plays his "Good People, Good Food" card for <b>8</b> <conspiracy-pool />. {{ playerTwo }} now has <b>0</b> <conspiracy-pool /> in his Conspiracy Pool. {{ playerOne }} cannot negate this card and Combat is initiated.</p>

    <p class="text-center">

    </p>
    <h3 id="31">
      Combat
    </h3>
    <p>When you encounter an Adversary which is not negated, Combat will follow. Unless an opponent plays a card which specifically allows him to do so, only one Adversary may be encountered at a time. Therefore, if opponents want to play more than one Adversary, each is resolved during a separate Combat.</p>
    <p>Combat typically occurs in two rounds. The first round is <b>Long Range Combat (LRC)</b> and the second is <b>Close Range Combat (CRC)</b>. Only one round of Long Range Combat occurs. After Long Range Combat, Close Range Combat rounds are repeated until the Adversary is killed or all Agents are sent to the Hospital. All damage inflicted during each round occurs simultaneously. Thus, it is possible for an Agent or Adversary to be removed by Combat and still inflict damage for that round.</p>
