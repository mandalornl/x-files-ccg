      The X-Files<sup>TM</sup> Collectible Card Game
    </h3>
    <p>Welcome to <b>The X-Files Collectible Card Game</b> Advanced Game. The Advanced Game incorporates many of the nuances of <b>The X-Files</b> television series and is designed for the more serious gamer and <b>The X-Files</b> fan.</p>
    <p>If you have not previously read the <b>Basic Game</b> rule book, we recommend that you read pages <page-link>4</page-link> through <page-link>7</page-link>; these pages will give you an introduction to <b>The X-Files Collectible Card Game</b> and the game's objective. If you are proceeding to the Advanced Game after learning the Basic Game, go on to the <b>Game Setup</b> section on the following page.</p>
    <p>In the Advanced Game, you will construct your deck of cards for game play. This gives each player greater control over the outcome of the game than in the Basic Game, where players use Starter Decks.The Advanced Game will allow each player to cater their Agents and cards to the Skills and strategy desired. It will be up to you to help Mulder and Scully solve their current X-File.</p>

      Advanced Game Set-up
    </h3>
    <p>The <b>Advanced Game</b> is designed for two or more players. The game is won by the first player who identifies one opponent's X-File. Game set-up for Advanced Game is similar to that of the Basic Game.</p>
    <p>For the Advanced Game, remove all Keyword <b>"Killer"</b> cards (see <b>Killer Cards</b> on page <page-link>42</page-link>). An explanation of all card types can be found on pages <page-link>48</page-link> through <page-link>63</page-link> of these rules. Agent cards may also be included in your deck for use during the game. They are shuffled into your deck and may assist for one turn (see <b>Playing Cards</b> section on page <page-link>14</page-link>). Separate your X-File cards and place them to the side.</p>
    <p>In the Advanced Game, you will be <u>constructing</u> your <b>Bureau Deck</b>. Your deck must have a minimum of sixty cards but may have more if you like. Your starting Agents and the X-File do not count toward this minimum. You may choose any cards, provided no more than two of the same card are used. You may include Agents in your deck. An Agent from your hand can be used to help out for one turn.</p>
    <p>Pay attention to the <b>Cost</b> to play each card. Having many cards that you cannot afford to play can de detrimental (see the <b>Playing Cards</b> section on page <page-link>41</page-link>). Note that you will probably want to create the Bureau Deck in conjunction with selecting Agents and an X-File. For additional Deck Construction suggestions, see page <page-link>46</page-link> of these rules.</p>
    <p>As in the Basic Game, select an X-File card.Place your X-File face down in a prominent place, as you may need to refer to it when your opponent asks questions.</p>

    </h4>
    <p>In the Advanced Game, you may choose any number of Agents you like for your initial <b>Team</b>, provided there are no duplicates and the sum of all Agents' Costs does not exceed 20.The Agent's Cost is a rating relative to each Agent's game value and appears in the lower right corner of the Agent card. Your Team should be a minimum of three Agents, but can be more. Each player is allowed to have the same Agent.</p>
    <p>Each player divides the surface area they are playing on into three sections: the <b>Bureau</b>, the <b>Fields</b> and the <b>Hospital</b>. Your Agents begin the game in the Bureau section.</p>
    <p>Creat a <b>Discard Pile</b> face-up next to your Bureau Deck when it becomes necessary. This will be used for discarding excess cards and cards you have used. Should the Bureau Deck ever run out of cards, shuffle your Discard Pile to recreate the Bureau Deck and  cotinue play.</p>
    <p><b>The X-Files Notebook</b> and <b>tokens</b> will also be needed for the Advanced Game. The Notebook is a checklist used to track information about your opponent's X-File(s). Tokens will be used to track certain information</p>

      Pools
    </h3>
    <p>In the Advanced Game, cards must be paid for in order to use their effects. This is done through the use of two pools: the <b>Resource Pool (RP)</b> and <b>Conspiracy Pool (CP)</b>. Each player will have one Conspiracy Pool and one Resource Pool.</p>
    <v-alert type="info">
      At the beginning of an Advanced Game, create the Resource Pool by placing five tokens in your Bureau section. Creat the Conspiracy Pool by placing five tokens by your X-File.
    </v-alert>
    <p>The Resource and Conspiracy Pools are used to pay for cards played by each player. All cards will have an <b>RP</b>, <b>CP</b> or <b>*P</b> icon - <resource-pool />, <conspiracy-pool /> or <star-pool /> -- under their Cost.</p>

      Resource Pool
    </h3>
    <p>Your <b>Resource Pool</b> represents the resource the Bureau has at its disposal. Resource Points are used to pay for the cards that assist your Agents. These cards have an <resource-pool /> or <star-pool /> under their Cost.</p>
    <p>During the <b>Briefing Phase</b>, you will have a chance to add to your Resource Pool. Every Agent has a Resource (<b>RES</b>) number listed on the upper right section of the card.</p>
    <v-alert

      color="info"
      class="text-center"
    >
      An example of an Agent card's RES Number. [[IMAGE]]
    </v-alert>
    <p>Add up all Agent's RES numbers. This is the number of tokens that may be added to the Resource Pool at the beginning of your turn. Agents in the Hospital during the Briefing Phase do not contribute their RES number to create <resource-pool />s. After adding the <resource-pool />s to your pool, you may then purchase cards. Each card costs <b>1</b> <resource-pool />. Purchased cards are always taken from the top of the Bureau Deck. All cards must be purchased ar once. A player may not purchase cards and then decide to purchase more after looking at the cards purchased. Regardless of how many cards are bought, no player's hand may exceed seven cards (but can be less) at the end of a turn.</p>
    <p>To keep the Resource Pool and Conspiracy Pool separate, we suggest putting the Resource Pool in the Bureau and the Conspiracy Pool by your X-File card.</p>
    <p class="text-center">
      11
    </p>
    <h3 id="12">
      Conspiracy Pool
    </h3>
    <p>Each player's X-File also has a pool used to purchase cards played. This is called the <b>Conspiracy Pool</b>. Your Conspiracy Pool represents the resources your X-File has at its disposal. Conspiracy Points are used to pay for cards used by the X-File to oppose investigations. These cards have a <conspiracy-pool /> or <star-pool /> under their cost.</p>
    <p>Replenishment of the Conspiracy Pool happens primarily during the opposing player's turn. When the Investigating Player has finished creating <resource-pool />s and buying cards during the Briefing Phase, all players other than the Investigating Player have the following options:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>The player to the Investigating Player's left may choose to discard cards from their hand with an <resource-pool /> or <star-pool /> Cost and add this number of <conspiracy-pool />s to their Conspiracy Pool. Thus, a card with <b>3</b> <conspiracy-pool /> Cost could be discarded in exchange for <b>3</b><conspiracy-pool />s.</li>
      <li>After the player has completed turning in cards, they may buy cards. Cards may be purchased for <b>1</b><conspiracy-pool /> each. Purchased cards are always taken from the top of the Bureau Deck. Regardless of how many cards are bought, any player's hand may not exceed seven cards (but can be less) at the end of a turn.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>In a multi-player game, continue to each player's left until all players have had these options.</p>
    <v-alert type="info">
      Each player must sell all cards desired prior to purchasing cards. All cards must be purchased at once. A player may not purchase cards and then decide to purchase more after looking at the cards purchased.
    </v-alert>
    <v-alert type="info">
      Agent cards included in your Bureau Deck may be sold for their RES (Resource) number of <conspiracy-pool />, not their Cost number.

      <p>Randy and Les are about to play a two-player Advanced Game. Each player constructs a sixty-card deck. Both players now choose an X-File and place the card face down. Randy selects Agents Fox Mulder, Dana Scully, Special Agent Karen Kosseff, and Jerry Lamana prior to starting the game. Agents Mulder and Scully each have a cost of <b>7</b> <resource-pool />. Agents Kosseff and Lamana each have a Cost of <b>3</b> <resource-pool />. Randy's Agent's total Cost is <b>20</b>. Since he is allowed no more than <b>20</b> <resource-pool /> for his starting Agents, this is a valid selection. He could have selected any Agents with a total Cost of <b>20</b> or less. Les also selects <b>20</b> points worth of Agents.</p>
      <p>Randy and Les each creat Bureau, Field and Hospital Sections on their playing surface. Each player places his Agents in the Bureau to start the game. Both player shuffle their cards and have the opponent cut them. These cards are placed face down in their Bureau Sections and become the Bureau decks. Randy and Les draw seven cards each to begin play.</p>
      <p>Each player now creates a Resource Pool (<resource-pool />) and a Conspiracy Pool (<conspiracy-pool />). Randy uses pennies as <resource-pool /> tokens and places five by his Bureau Deck to create this pool. He uses nickels for <resource-pool /> tokens and places five by his X-File card. Les does the same. Randy wins a coin toss and elects to go first. Randy and Les are now ready to begin the Advanced Game.</p>

      Playing Cards
    </h3>
    <p>The system by which cards are played in the Advanced Game is different from the Basic Game. Each card now has a "<b>Cost</b>" associated with playing it. You must pay the Cost to use the card's effect. Other than Cost, there is no limit to the number of cards you may play. If at any time a player plays a card and then determines they can't afford it, the card is placed on the owning player's Discard Pile. When any contradiction arises between card effects and rules, the card effect supersedes the rules.</p>
    <p>Each card will have a <resource-pool />, <conspiracy-pool /> or <star-pool /> under their <b>Cost</b> value. This indicates from which pool the cost must be paid. <resource-pool /> stands for <b>Resource Pool</b>, <conspiracy-pool /> for <b>Conspiracy Pool</b> and <star-pool /> for either.</p>
    <p>Cards with a <resource-pool /> may only be paid for by the <b>Active Player</b>.</p>
    <p>Cards with a <conspiracy-pool /> Cost may only be paid for by the <b>Conspiracy</b>.</p>
    <p>Cards with a <star-pool /> may be used by either force -- however, whichever force uses it must pay for it. See the <b>Pools</b> section on page <page-link>10</page-link> for further information.</p>
    <p>If a card has multiple effects, indicated by the phrase "Alternately" appearing on the card, the owning player must specify which effect is being used upon playing the card. They may not change to the other effect later.</p>
    <p>In addition, all cards contain <b>Keywords</b> and <b>Activators</b>. These often serve as codes indicating when cards may be playerd. See the <b>Keywords</b> section on page <page-link>17</page-link> and the <b>Activators</b> section on page <page-link>16</page-link> for further information.</p>
    <p class="text-center">

    </p>
    <h3 id="15">
      Agent Cards
    </h3>
    <p>Agent cards contain a <b>Game Effect</b> in the center of the card. This is a special effect related to the Agent's significance in <b>The X-Files</b> television series. Each of the Agents you selected to begin play may use their Game Effect.</p>
    <p>In addition to your Agents selected at the beginning of the game, you may include additional Agent cards in your Bureau Deck which can be purchased to aid for a single turn. A purchased Agent may contribute as a normal Agent for most of your turn, however their Game Effect is ignored.</p>
    <p>Agents may only be purchased during the <b>Deployment Phase</b>. A purchased Agent is treated as an Active card. When you reach the <b>Debriefing Phase</b>, the Agent is moved to the Discard Pile. You may not use duplicate Agent cards. This means you cannot purchase two of the same Agents in the same turn or purchase an Agent you already have in play.</p>

      Activators
    </h3>
    <p>Activators appear in gold in the lower left corner on a particular card. Simply stated, an Activator tells you when you may play a particular card. Acticators can be grouped into three main categories:</p>
    <p><b>ACTIVE</b>: May be played while you are the Investigating Player. You may play these cards when it is your turn.</p>
    <p><b>CONSPIRACY</b>: May be played when your are not the Investigating Player. You may play these cards during another player's turn.</p>
    <p><b>All other Activator Words</b>: May be played only in certain circumstances. The Activator tells you where or when a card may be played or what type of card currently in use a card may be played on. Refer to the Keyword on the card in play to determine if you may play your card.</p>
    <p>On an <b>Adversary</b> or <b>Event</b> card, the Activator states what conditions must be met for the card to be used. On an Equipment card, the Activator tells you what section the Agent must be in to Requisition the Equipment.</p>
    <v-alert type="info">
      All Activators must be in effect in order for the card to be played.

      Keywords
    </h3>
    <p><b>Keywords</b> appear in red in the lower left corner on a particular card. The Keyword tells you what a card is.</p>
    <p>Most often, you will check the Keywords on an opponent's card to determine if you have a playable card. If your card's Activators are contained in the other card's Keyword section, you may play your card.</p>

      Randy consults his "Townsend, WI" Site card. He discovers the Keywords "<b>SITE</b>", "<b>MULTI</b>", "<b>MOTIVE</b>", "<b>RESULT</b>", "<b>ALIEN INVESTIGATION</b>" and "<b>BUREAUCRACY</b>". From this, Randy determines that the card is a Site with multiple Skills and questions. The Skills which can be used are Alien Investigation or Bureaucracy and the question hey may ask upon a successful investigation is either a RESULT or MOTIVE question.
    </v-alert>
    <p>There are serveral cards which change another card's Keywords. When this occurs, only the Keyword is changed. The rest of the card remains unchanged.</p>
    <h3>Resources</h3>
    <p>One particular Keyword worth special mentions is "<b>RESOURCE</b>". The Keyword RESOURCE will appear on certain cards. A card with the Keyword "RESOURCE" remains in play in the table section stated by the Keyword on the card. If no table section is indicated on the card, place the card face up in your Bureau section. These cards remain in play until they are negated or the criteria for their removal (if listed on the Resource card) is met. When this occurs, the card is moved to your Discard Pile.</p>
